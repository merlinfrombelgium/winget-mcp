- Error Handling: Structured error management with user-friendly messages

### Enhanced Requirements Delivered
- Dual Technology Stack: Both Python FastMCP and .NET implementations
- Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests, functional tests, and integration validation
- Official Validation: MCP Inspector compliance verification
- Security Framework: Layered defense with input validation and command sanitization
- Documentation: Complete implementation guides and architectural documentation

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Technology Stack Evolution
**Original Plan**: Node.js with TypeScript
**Final Implementation**: Python FastMCP (Primary) + .NET 8.0 (Secondary)

**Rationale for Change**:
- Python FastMCP identified as official primary MCP SDK (14.6k+ GitHub stars)
- Better ecosystem support and community adoption
- Faster development path with comprehensive examples
- Enhanced Windows package management integration capabilities

### Architecture Overview

#### Python Implementation (Primary)
- **Framework**: FastMCP with MCP SDK v1.9.4
- **Structure**: Modular design with separated concerns
  - server.py: FastMCP server initialization and tool registration
  - winget_manager.py: WinGet CLI integration and command execution
  - tools/: Individual tool implementations (search, list, info, install)
  - security/: Input validation and command sanitization
  - utils/: Error handling and logging utilities
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with 13/13 tests passing
- **Validation**: Official MCP Inspector compliance verified

#### .NET Implementation (Secondary)
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0 with Microsoft.Extensions ecosystem
- **Structure**: Enterprise-grade architecture with dependency injection
  - Program.cs: MCP protocol JSON-RPC handling over stdin/stdout
  - Services/: WinGet service layer with caching and concurrency control
  - Tools/: MCP tool implementations with proper validation
  - Models/: Strongly-typed data models and exception handling
  - Infrastructure/: Dependency injection and service configuration
- **Status**: MCP protocol functional, WinGet output parsing needs refinement
- **Security**: Built-in validation with comprehensive error handling

## TESTING STRATEGY & RESULTS

### Python Implementation Testing
**Test Suite**: tests/test_server.py and tests/test_functional.py

#### Unit Tests (6/6 Passing)
- FastMCP server instance creation and naming
- Server MCP method availability (list_tools, call_tool, run)
- Tool registration verification (4 tools properly registered)
- Tool execution functionality (async operations working)
- WinGet CLI availability and functionality
- WinGet search command operational

#### Functional Tests (7/7 Passing)
- Search tool complete functionality with structured JSON responses
- List tool functionality and proper response format
- Info tool functionality for package information retrieval
- Install tool structure validation (safe dry run testing)
- All tools registration and MCP accessibility
- MCP protocol compliance validation
- Tool schema validation (name, description, inputSchema)

#### External Validation
- **MCP Inspector Validation**: Official tool confirms full protocol compliance
- **Command**: npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli --method tools/list python main.py
- **Result**: All 4 tools discoverable with proper schema validation

### .NET Implementation Testing
**Manual Testing**: JSON-RPC protocol validation

#### Protocol Compliance (Functional)
- initialize method responds correctly with protocol version 2024-11-05
- tools/list method returns proper tool schema for search tool
- tools/call method accepts and processes search requests
- JSON-RPC protocol handling implemented correctly
- Error handling and logging operational

#### Identified Issues (Needs Resolution)
- **WinGet Output Parsing**: Current logic returns 0 packages due to format complexity
- **Package Vulnerabilities**: Using older NuGet packages with security warnings
- **Missing Tools**: Only search tool implemented, missing list, info, install tools

## LESSONS LEARNED

### Technology Decision Process
- **Early Validation Critical**: Technology stack validation should occur before significant implementation investment
- **Official Documentation Priority**: Always prioritize officially recommended technologies over assumptions
- **Community Adoption Indicator**: GitHub stars and ecosystem maturity are strong indicators of technology viability

### Dual Implementation Value
- **Architectural Validation**: Implementing the same functionality in multiple languages validates design decisions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Common patterns emerge that can be templated for future projects
- **Risk Mitigation**: Multiple implementations provide fallback options and technology choice flexibility

### QA Process Insights
- **Cross-Implementation Testing**: When multiple implementations exist, QA should compare and validate both
- **External Tool Validation**: Official validation tools provide authoritative compliance verification
- **Continuous Testing**: Early and frequent testing prevents late-stage discovery of critical issues

### MCP Protocol Patterns
- **Tool Registration**: Consistent patterns for tool schema definition and registration
- **JSON-RPC Handling**: Standard approaches for request/response processing and error management
- **Security Integration**: Common patterns for input validation and safe command execution

## TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Future MCP Server Development
1. **Template Creation**:
   - Python FastMCP template with security framework
   - .NET MCP template with enterprise patterns
   - Common tool implementation patterns

2. **Utility Libraries**:
